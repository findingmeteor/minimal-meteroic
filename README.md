# Minimal boilerplate for Meteoric

Basic project to start playing with Meteoric.

## Known issues

The first time meteor starts the following exception is shown.
```
While building the application:
	client/stylecheets/app.scss: Scss compiler error: undefined
	/Users/humber/github/findingmeteor/minimal-meteroic/client/stylecheets/app.scss:2: file to import
	not found or unreadable:
	'.meteor/local/build/programs/server/assets/packages/meteoric_ionic-sass/ionic'
	Current dir: /Users/humber/github/findingmeteor/minimal-meteroic/client/stylecheets/
```

Just ctrl+c the process and run it again (This is workaround)
